      "<h2>An Introduction to SQL Relationships</h2>\n",
      "\n",
      "As I've mentioned, SQL databases allow for you to build <b>relationships</b> between the tables of your database. This is handled through <b>Foreign Keys</b>, which is a new kind of Column we haven't yet seen. Effectively, a Foreign Key is a piece of information (usually the integer primary key) that uniquely identifies the object with which the current object has a relationship. There are several key permutations of relationships that you can use:\n",
      "\n",
      "<table>\n",
      "<li>One to one\n",
      "<li>One to many\n",
      "<li>Many to many\n",
      "</table>\n",
      "The relationship types are pretty self-explanatory. A <b>one to one relationship</b> links a specific object, let's say a Star, to another specific object, let's say a SkyCoordinates object. Each Star has exactly one SkyCoordinates object, and each SkyCoordinates object has exactly one Star.\n",
      "\n",
      "A <b>one to many relationship</b> links a specific object, let's say Photometry, to another, again a Star, just like in a one to one relationship; however, the linked object is allowed to be related to more than one of the original object. In this case, a Star can have more than one Photometry object, but each Photometry object is associated with exactly one Star.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, a <b>many to many relationship</b> links two types of objects, let's say Tag and Star. The Star object can have multiple Tags. But you likely will want to treat these like categories, so each Tag should be able to associate with multiple Stars as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the obvious question is, 'Why aren't we starting with one to one? It's probably easier.' And you'd be almost right. The issue with one to one relationships is that they normally aren't that useful, and so they're usually implemented as a slight alteration of a one to many relationship in which the 'many' part is restricted to be 'one.' Note in the above example that I used a Star object and a SkyCoordinates object; whereas, in the previous notebook, I suggested you include the coordinates in the Star object. In general, with any one to one relationship, the contents of the related object can simply be added as additional columns in the original, making them not terribly useful."

A comment about style: we decided to make the photometry its own object rather than folding it into the Star object. This is for a couple reasons: if we want to track the photometry over time, we'll need to have multiple values for each filter. This brings up an interesting point: you can't put an array into a database column. If you want to have multiple values of a particular thing, you'll need to set up a new table and add a one to many relationship from there. In addition, we can add an arbitrary number of filters to each object. If we had declared the columns within the star class, we would be restricted to those filters.\n",
