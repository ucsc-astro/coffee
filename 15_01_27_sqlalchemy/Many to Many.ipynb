      "Once you gain some confidence with the SQLAlchemy commands, you can do some fancy querying. Below is an example of the use of a <b>subquery</b>. In effect, this is like generating an intermediate table that can be filled with derived quantities which can then be filtered appropriately. For example, the below commands return any tags with more than 3 associated stars. For your first time through, don't worry about reading the following break down, just take a look at the result and continue on to the next notebook [here](Examples.ipynb).\n",

The func.count ('\\*') command informs SQLAlchemy that we actually want a count of all the contained objects rather than a list. We label the count column as \"count\" for later use. With just that, we'd actually only get the total number of tags. We need to specify that we want to look at the contained Star objects, which we do with a join command. This joins the Tag table with the Star table; however, since Tag does not have an explicit Foreign Key to Star, we need to point it toward the relationship between the two in the second argument of join.\n",

We need to filter the results of this query, so we use a subquery.\n",
